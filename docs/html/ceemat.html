				<p> CeeMat is a dynamic seeing mat for learning and understanding physical computing. It is a physical product that bridges the interaction between physical and digital objects through a touchable interface. It is a concept design developed to become integrated within learning environments of the future.</p>

			<div class="order2">
				<p> This project explores how online, physical and hybrid learning environments can be explored to create learning environments of the future. As teams, we focused on designing for students of Carnegie Mellon's IDEATE program located at the Hunt Library - in particular, the students taking the course Physical Computing. Some of the issues many new programs face revolve around funding, sharing of resources and spaces, culture, etc. </p>

				<p>Physical Computing is a popular course within the program, however, it faces a drop out rate of ~40% during new semesters. Many students find it difficult to learn the material. Therefore, the issues we wanted to address were the lack of resource sharing and methods of improving the learning experience.</p>

		<!-- body paragraph-->
		<div class="projectcolumn">
			<div class="order2">
				<h4>Developing digital tools that simplify and replace traditional learning that utilize physical tools.</h4>

				<p>We identified core issues students faced within the course and developed the concept of CeeMat, which is a physical, dynamic seeing mat that revolves around 3 core realms:
				<h5>1. SeeingKit </h5>
				<p> The ability to use dynamic tools for seeing states and connectivity.</p>
				<h5> 2. Digital Toolbox </h5> 
				<p> Digital prototyping of physical components.</p>
				<h5>3. Guided Learning </h5>
				<p> Responsive step-by-step instructions.</p>

				<h5>Target Audience</h5>

				<p>To fully understand some of the difficulties faced by the students within Physical Computing, we conducted some preliminary interviews, while also attempted some of their classwork on our own to have hands-on experience with the course content.</p>

				<h5>Issues Today</h5>

				<p>- Lack of out-of-classroom learning tools for difficult material<br>
				- Not keen on staying in space to work<br>
				- Limited resources as students tend to work at home<br>
				- Confusion added when trying to learn between materials - circuits, laptop handout, paper sketches and notes.</p>

				<h5>Design Approaches</h5>

				<p>- Study natural, instinctive ways of learning<br>
				- Develop solutions to user-centered problems</p>

				<p>CeeMat introduces a novel interpretation of hybrid environments where digital and physical components exist as a single, continuous material. The features of the physical mat address the existing problems physical computing students face.</p>

				<p>CeeMat has the ability to detect physical objects placed on its surface, and provide additional information if prompted by the user (shown in first video).</p>

				<h4>Digital prototyping of physical components.</h4>

				<p> As a user interested in physical computing, we may not always have all the components needed for play. CeeMat provides a digital toolbox that allows for circuit completion with your physical components. Towards the second half of the video below, a shopping assistant is also prompted - from which, the user would be able to purchase the appropriate components.</p>

				<h4>Responsive step-by-step instructions</h4>

				<p> Below is an earlier prototype of the forms of guided learning tutorials that would exist in this interface. Our original designs were skewed as we experienced some resolution distortion between our designs and projection hardware. Inspired by existing traditional and modern forms of guided learning - from Lego building manuals to step-by-step play of Cooking Mama; we wanted to create a learning experience that reflected the same ease of use.</p>
